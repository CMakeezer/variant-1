**Eggs.Variant**
==================

## Introduction ##

**Eggs.Variant** is a **C++11/14** generic, type-safe, discriminated union. See the documentation at http://eggs-cpp.github.io/variant/.

## Requirements ##

The library requires a standard conformant implementation of **C++11**; a few additional features are only available under **C++14**. Some effort was done to support incomplete language or standard library implementations &mdash;see [Config](http://eggs-cpp.github.io/variant/config.html "Config - Eggs.Variant")&mdash;. There are no external dependencies.

The library was successfully tested with the following configurations [*]:

 - _Clang_ 3.3, 3.4 (both with _libc++_ and _libstdc++_)
 - _GCC_ 4.8, 4.9
 - _MSVC_ 2013

[*] Only _Clang_ with _libc++_ implement enough functionality to support every feature of the library.

## Future Work ##

The following is an incomplete list of pending functionality to be implemented:

 - Type-safe trivially copyable `variant<Ts...>`. A trivially copyable type needs not be copyable, but the special storage used for those types will be. Requires an underlying `union` as storage.

 - Literal `variant<Ts...>` when all `T` in `Ts...` are literal types. A conversion from `void*` to a pointer-to-object type is not allowed in a `constexpr` function, which rules out the aligned storage implementation. Requires an underlying `union` as storage.
 
 - Explicit control over the type of the discriminator, introduced via a `basic_variant` class template.

 - Layout optimization. Requires even more flavors of special storage.
