# Requirements

The library requires a standard conformant implementation of **C++11**; a few additional features are only available under **C++14**. Some effort was done to support incomplete language or standard library implementations &mdash;see [Config](http://eggs-cpp.github.io/variant/config.html "Config - Eggs.Variant")&mdash;. There are no external dependencies.

The library was successfully tested with the following configurations [*]:

 - _Clang_ 3.3, 3.4 (both with _libc++_ and _libstdc++_)
 - _GCC_ 4.8, 4.9
 - _MSVC_ 2013

[*] Only _Clang_ with _libc++_ implement enough functionality to support every feature of the library.
